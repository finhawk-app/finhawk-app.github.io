    <p>A detailed analysis of a swing trade on Tech Mahindra using support and resistance line.</p>

<p>In the current volatile market, a trading setup needed to be identified which was predictable in nature. Observing the market trend, various sector index trends and stocks in the watchlist, Tech Mahindra was selected as it was trading in a range. The strategy was not to lookout for a breakout but to trade on the highs and lows of the trading range. For this, a daily chart of Tech Mahindra is plotted alongside volume<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and ATR<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h1 id="drawing-support--resistance-lines">Drawing Support &amp; Resistance Lines</h1>

<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/finhawk_static/Blog/Techmahindra_support_resistance.png" alt="Tech Mahindra - Support &amp; Resistance Line" /></p>

<p>The strategy for trading in a range is to buy at the low of the trading range and then sell at the high. First thing was to identify the support and resistance line:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A resistance line was established at 500 by joining the lows on reactions on 24th April and 5th May. This would help in identifying the buying region</li>
  <li>A support line was established at 548 by joining the highs on rallies on 30th April and 13th May. This would help in identifying the selling region</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="confirming-the-rally">Confirming the rally</h1>

<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/finhawk_static/Blog/Techmahindra_analysis.png" alt="Tech Mahindra - Analysis" /></p>

<p>On 18th May, when the reaction was about to hit the resistance line, the following analysis was done:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Filter out the possibility of a breakout - Despite the high volumes on the last rally on 4th May, the volumes on 18th May (and before that) are less therefore indicating that the probability of a breakout is less</li>
  <li>Confirming the start of the rally - On the next day, a green candle with the price ending on 514 confirms that the rally has started. So the trade can be entered on 20th May morning at a price around 514.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="profit-stop-loss-and-position-size-for-the-trade">Profit, Stop Loss and Position Size for the Trade</h1>

<p>After confirming that the rally has started, estimated risk reward ratio of trade was calculated, before committing to the trade:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Profit scenario: The profitable exit point for such a trade can be placed  at the support line at 548. So possible profit was 34 (548-514)</li>
  <li>Stop Loss: ATR at the time of entry is 24. Stop loss can be placed at 1 ATR away from the entry condition i.e 490 (514-24)</li>
  <li>Risk Reward Ratio for the trade was 0.70 (24/34). Most traders use a risk-reward ratio between 0.25 and 1. So the risk reward ratio of 0.70 fits the criteria.</li>
  <li>Position Size for the trade: To calculate the size for the trade, the following method was used:
    <ul>
      <li>Position Sizing = 1%xTotal Capital/Risk where 1% denotes the risk appetite of the trader</li>
      <li>Assuming total trading capital is of Rs. 5 lakhs so the position size for the trade would be 208 shares (1%x5 lakhs/24)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="profit--loss">Profit &amp; Loss</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Entry point: 514 (After confirming the rally via green candle on day next to 18th May when support line was touched)</li>
  <li>Exit point: 548 (on 1st June when price hits the line of resistance)</li>
  <li>Profit per share: 34</li>
  <li>P&amp;L (assuming 208 shares) = 208*35 = Rs. 7,072</li>
</ol>

      <p>Volume or any other volume indicators like Accumulation distribution line, OBV, CMF can be used to gauge increasing buying or selling pressure. This can also be used to predict an upcoming breakout <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Breakouts are supported by a multi-year low ATR. ATR can be additionally used for putting the stop loss <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
