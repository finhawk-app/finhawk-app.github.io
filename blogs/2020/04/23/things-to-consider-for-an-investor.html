<p>We are currently going through an unprecedented health crisis and this has led to a prolonged stock market crash. While market corrections happen from time-to-time, the impact of the novel coronavirus has been big on the markets.</p>

<p>To get a sense of the impact on the markets, let’s look at movement of the major indices in last 1 month:</p>
<ol>
  <li>S&amp;P 500<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> has dropped 1000 points</li>
  <li>NIFTY<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> has dropped 4900 points</li>
  <li>FTSE<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> has dropped 2500 points</li>
</ol>

<p>What this means is that there would be an impact on retail investors’ capital. We have looked at the data for all popular products (in India) and their current returns (Shown in table 1). Apart from debt funds and Gold ETFs, all other types of funds have seen a decrease in their value.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type of instrument</th>
      <th>Returns expected</th>
      <th>Current 1 year returns<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>MFs - All equity funds<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></td>
      <td>10-12%<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></td>
      <td>-17.3% (Average for 5-star and 4-star equity funds)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></td>

      <td>5-15%<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></td>
      <td>7.53% (Average for 5-star and 4-star debt funds)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MFs - Hybrid funds</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-4.22% (Average for 5-star and 4-star hybrid funds)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ETFs</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-23.15% (Average of top 22 ETFs)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gold ETFs</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>6.21% (Average of all gold ETFs)*</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It’s important to be cognizant of the fact that during such crises, some businesses can also shut down. These businesses may further impact other businesses which are dependent on them. Such a scenario can have rippling effects of people losing jobs, decrease in global and local consumption, decrease in exports and thereby declined growth.</p>

<p>Since health organizations are still looking for a solution and governments are working to fight against the spread of the virus, the scale of the economic impact can not yet be predicted. So, there will be aftereffects of this health disaster on economic functioning.</p>

<h2 id="monitor-your-financial-assets-periodically">Monitor your financial assets periodically</h2>

<p>A few things that a retail investor could do is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the current value of their portfolio/capital.</li>
  <li>Understand the composition of MFs, ETFs in which they are invested, in as much detail as possible. There are many online portals<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> which provide ratings and composition of financial products.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don’t understand the product you are invested then, then you can do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read a book which explains the product in first principles<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
  <li>Consult a financial advisor on their views on the product</li>
  <li>Go through a credible source which releases unbiased information about financial products via blogs<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>, podcasts<sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>,  and social media services.</sup></li>
</ol>

<p>A smart investor would understand a product before they buy it and then monitor them periodically.</p>

<h2 id="does-a-market-crash-imply-an-opportunity-to-buy">Does a market crash imply an opportunity to buy?</h2>

<p>One of the most important concepts of trading and investment is to buy a stock or an asset when it is cheap or under-priced and sell it when it is expensive or overvalued. If the stock markets undergo a significant decline, does it imply that it is a good opportunity to buy or invest?</p>

<p>Let’s look at what a smart investor would do before deciding to buy anything:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set aside enough cash buffer for their monthly expenditures for at least 6 months. Only if they have extra surplus cash, would they decide to buy</li>
  <li>Look at sectors that would get least impacted during the time and also flourish in the future. They would understand how the business works:
    <ul>
      <li>Identify what line of services or products a company in that sector provides</li>
      <li>Understand if the demand for their product and service would continue to grow despite slowdown and changes in the economy.</li>
      <li>Understand the business model and margins in the business</li>
      <li>Articulate their hypothesis for growth potential and stable returns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the sector that would survive and flourish, they would:
    <ul>
      <li>Identify companies with healthy cash reserves<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> and a good profit margin<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup></li>
      <li>Identify and remove those companies which have a high debt to equity ratio <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> and low cash ratios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So like a smart investor, do full due diligence on the financial product and business that you may want to invest in. Just because the value of a stock or asset has fallen doesn’t necessarily qualify it to be a great deal.</p>

<h2 id="basics-about-various-financial-instruments">Basics about various financial instruments</h2>
<ol>
  <li>MFs - All equity funds. Equity mutual funds try generating high returns by investing in the stocks of companies. Equity mutual funds are the riskiest class of mutual funds, and hence, they have the potential to provide higher returns than debt and hybrid funds.</li>
  <li>MFs - All debt funds. A debt fund invests in fixed-interest generating securities such as corporate bonds, government securities, treasury bills, commercial paper and other money market instruments. The fundamental reason for investing in debt funds is to earn interest income and capital appreciation.</li>
  <li>Hybrid Funds. Hybrid funds invest in both debt and equity instruments to achieve diversification and avoid the concentration risk. A perfect blend of the two offers higher returns than a regular debt fund while not being as risky as equity funds.
    <ul>
      <li>A hybrid mutual fund scheme that invests over 65% of its corpus in equities and the remaining in debt is called an Equity-Oriented Hybrid Mutual Fund.</li>
      <li>Conversely, a hybrid mutual fund scheme that invests over 65% of its corpus in debt instruments and the remaining into equity is called a Debt-Oriented Hybrid Mutual Fund.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nifty ETFs (Exchange traded funds) - Various mutual funds provide ETF products that attempt to replicate the indices on NSE, so as to provide returns that closely correspond to the total returns of the securities represented in the index</li>
  <li>Gold ETFs - A gold ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a commodity ETF that consists of only one principal asset: gold. Investors use gold ETFs to track and reflect the price of gold. A gold ETF gives an investor an opportunity to gain exposure to the performance, or price movements, of gold.</li>
</ol>
